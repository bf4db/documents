# BF4DB Contributions
## Last Updated: 05/03/2017

BF4DB was conceptualized, built, and managed by a dedicated team of volunteers. Everything from designing and building the website itself, to managing the servers it runs on, to developing new features such as our streaming plugin is all accomplished by people taking time out of their busy days to volunteer to the cause at BF4DB. There's no monetary gain by anyone involved and everything that is earned is put right back into the site to maintain the services we do have to pay for to keep the lights on, so to speak.

And all of the above doesn't even take into account the time that is spent by the Admins and Moderators sifting through hundreds of player reports and investigating hackers, cheaters, glitchers, stat-padders, and players who are actually clean. Overall, it's a very time consuming process, and we are very grateful for the time put in by everyone involved.

Even though none of the developers, admins, or moderators are receiving any kind of pay, we still have monthly costs attributed to the website. Right now, those costs are for the several servers that the website runs off of. As you may have noticed, we run one small ad on the bottom of the website which gives us a very small amount of earnings from Google. We have also been lucky and received a few contributions from some staff members as well as members of the public. BF4DB relies on these contributions to keep everything running so we can continue to develop and maintain everything we offer.

Your generosity goes directly to our server provider. Right now we currently accept payments from Debit and Credit cards through Stripe, our payment gateway. We are currently working on implementing PayPal so those who wish to use PayPal can do so as well. We understand that not everyone wants to use a debit or credit card number online and prefer the ease of PayPal, which is why we're working to implement that.

If you enjoy what we offer at BF4DB, please consider contributing to our ongoing mission to detect and eliminate hackers from Battlefield 4. We are grateful and so thankful for every contribution, whether it's $1.00 or $10.00, or more, every little bit helps. Thank you again for your support of BF4DB, and we look forward to continuing to serve the Battlefield community for years to come. If you have any questions about contributions, where they go, or have any other questions, please don't hesitate to PM Sovereign_Skies on the website, or on Discord.

Kind regards,

BF4DB Staff
